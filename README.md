# Blood Donor and Cirrhosis Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes a dataset of blood donors and cirrhosis patients to explore and predict health conditions. The dataset includes various medical metrics such as age, sex, and biochemical markers.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Category`: Health condition (e.g., Blood Donor, Cirrhosis)
- `Age`: Age of the patient
- `Sex`: Gender of the patient
- `ALB`: Albumin levels
- `ALP`: Alkaline phosphatase levels
- `ALT`: Alanine transaminase levels
- `AST`: Aspartate transaminase levels
- `BIL`: Bilirubin levels
- `CHE`: Cholinesterase levels
- `CHOL`: Cholesterol levels
- `CREA`: Creatinine levels
- `GGT`: Gamma-glutamyl transferase levels
- `PROT`: Protein levels

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `README.md`: This README file.
